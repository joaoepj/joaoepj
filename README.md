- 👋 Hi, I’m @joaoepj
- 👀 I’m interested in softwarized networks management and operation. I've been working in academy with openFlow and P4 switches, Floodlight SDN controller and network programming languages like (frenetic). Ultimately I've been investigating how to improve the design and develpoment of network management services and APIs throught information/networking api modeling (YANG).
- 🌱 With solid professional experience in network and systems administration. I’m currently getting used to DevOps technologies and best practices (docker, kubernetes, Go, git) in order to apply such knowledge into cloud native applications
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on TMFORUM's Open Digital Framework/Architecture ODF/ODA ecosystem including vendor's products and telecom's services developments
- 📫 You can reach me over the Internet
